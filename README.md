👨‍💻 About me

I'm a Java-focused developer with strong fundamentals in backend systems and practical full‑stack experience. I'm curious, love clean code, and enjoy building projects that teach me something new — whether it's IoT integrations, blockchain experiments or polished web frontends. When I'm not coding, you'll find me buried in a good book.
